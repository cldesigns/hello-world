	<h3>Origin</h3>
	<p>The original cat bread photo was posted to both Reddit[1] and Tumblr[3] on August 2nd, 2011, where it received over 51,000 notes in six months. It was reshared on humor blogs Tastefully Offensive[4] and Bits and Pieces[5] the same day. On the 19th of that month, it was posted to the pics subreddit[2], receiving 8,095 up votes and 6,964 down votes.</p>
	<h3>Spread</h3>
	<p>That same month, examples of inbred cat photos were posted onto Uproxx[17] and a Facebook page[6] was launched to compile in-bread cat images. On October 2nd, Tumblr blogger lightrup[7] posted a photoset of her cat in bread, which accumulated over 11,000 notes in three months. Another photo was posted to the blog When Parents Text[12] in December 2011.
On January 31st, 2012, Gawker published an article[8] describing the practice of breading cats as a "hot new internet meme." Throughout the day, two follow up articles were posted with relevant tweets[9] and submitted photographs[10] of cats with bread hats.
The same day as the Gawker posts, cat breading was featured on the International Business Times[13], Metro[14], the Tosh.0 blog[15], and humor site The FW.[16] On February 1st, the photos hit Australia's Herald Sun[18], Kansas City's Fox 4 News[19], and fashion blog Refinery29.[20]</p>
